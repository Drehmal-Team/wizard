# Drehmal 2.2 : Apotheosis Official Installer

Relating to drehmal.net <br>
The Official installer for the hit minecraft map Drehmal 2.2 : Apotheosis,
including full texture work, sounds and animations (as well as a progress bar !) <br>
Made by MoutonDemocrate, you can find me in the [Drehmal Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ECuA8nm2) if you have any questions !
> ### Warning : this is a BETA build ! This installer is unstable and may not work properly ! 

===

## How to use :

This should be as simple as executing the files provided in releases.
If you do not know how to so that, look it up yourself !<br>
It's easier than me explaining it.

===

## Support :

If you have any issues, first off, go check if your issue is already in the [Issues](https://github.com/Drehmal-Team/wizard/issues) sections of the GitHub page. If it exists, you can add your case in the comments ! It's always helpful to know if multiple people have experienced the issues. <br>
If that's not the case create your own new issue, and tag it correctly.

When reporting a bug, Please give your operating system and which type of install you've chosen (Singleplayer, Multiplayer/Client, ~~and Multiplayer/Server~~).
Additionally, please upload your log file too, it's the most important thing you can do for the issue to be fixed.

> ### How can I find my log file ?
>
> It's a file located in the your user folder.<br>
> "But Mouton !" I hear you say, "Where is my user folder ?" <br>
> It depends on your operating system. Here is where it is usually located :
>
> Linux-based distros : `~/.local/share/Primordial Team/Drehmal Installer/logs` <br>
> Windows : `~/Library/Application Support/Primordial Team/Drehmal Installer/logs` <br>
> macOS : `%APPDATA%/Primordial Team/Drehmal Installer/logs` <br>
>
> In that folder, your log file is the most recent one.
> Contact us on the discord if you experience any issues.

Please take some of your time to properly report the issues, I know it can be annoying but it's extremely helpful. That's the best thing you could do to support the installer project and to honor the time it took to make this installation wizard. Thank you in advance <3
