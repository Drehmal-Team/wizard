# Drehmal 2.2 : Apotheosis Official Installer

Relating to drehmal.net
A little installer to install your favourite minecraft map more easily !
Includes full texture work, sounds and animations (as well as a progress bar !)
### Warning : this is a BETA build ! This installer is unstable and may not work properly ! 


## How to use :
This should be as simple as executing the files provided in releases.
If you do not know how to so that, look it up yourself !
It's easier than me explaining it.

## Support :
If you have an issue, please make a support thread in the "issues" section.
However, please try to see if anyone has had your issue before asking for help.
